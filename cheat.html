            <h1>CHEAT SHEET AND GAMEPLAY</h1>
			<br>
			<h2>STARVIEW VALLEY</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>GOAL</h3>
			<p>To raise a minimum of 2,500 gold in 30 days. </p>
			<h3>CHEATS</h3>
			<p><span>To see WIN condition:</span> Open the console and type in 'money = 2500' and sleep until Day 30.
			<br><br>

			<span>To see LOSE condition:</span> Don't do anything to gain gold. End day repeatedly until you reach Day 30.<br><br>

			<span>To gain enough gold instantly to win the game:</span> Go to the mountain and enter the dungeon. 
			Do not kill the first monster you encounter. Instead, dig to the lowest level (Lv. 9) and then proceed with the 
			battle and defeat it before the timer runs out. Leave the dungeon immediately. Go to sleep until Day 30.</p><br>
			<h3>GAMEPLAY</h3><br>
			<p>
				<span>ENERGY</span><br><br>The player starts with 240 energy points, represented by a full green bar. Most in-game 
				actions carry an energy cost. To expound:<br><br>

				a. Moving from one location to another (20)<br>
				b. Foraging<br>
					- Clicking on items (10)<br>
					- Searching for more (15)<br>
				c. Farming<br>
					- Using hoe, hand for picking / harvesting  (10)<br>
					- Using watering can (5) <br><br>

				Buying, selling, and going from one area to another in the same location do not reduce the player's energy.
				Once energy drops to 0 (zero), the health bar will go down at twice the rate.<br><br>
				
				<span>HEALTH</span><br><br>The player starts with 100 health points, represented by a full green bar below the energy bar. 
				There are two instances wherein the player's health decreases:<br><br>

				a. Performing actions when energy is 0 (zero), and<br>
				b. Fighting monsters in the dungeon.<br><br>

				Unlike energy points, a player's health can be increased by purchasing upgrades in the Adventurer's Guild.<br><br>
				
				<span>PASSING OUT</span><br><br>Once health drops to 0 (zero), the player will pass out.  This will result in a 
				time-skip of 5 (five) days as well as a penalty of 50% less energy upon "waking up".<br><br>
				
				<span>BUYING</span><br><br>There are two locations where this can be done:<br>

					a. Pierre's Shop - The following seeds can be bought here:<br>
						- Parsnip (20 gold)<br>
						- Cauliflower (80)<br>
						- Bean starter (60)<br>
						- Jazz (30)<br>
						- Garlic (40)<br>
						- Strawberry (100)<br><br>
					b. Adventurer's Guild - Combat upgrades can be bought here. Some of the attributes, such as attack points and health, can be upgraded multiple times. <br>
						- Upgrade weapon (5 gold)<br>
						- Upgrade skin (100)<br>
						- Upgrade shield (10)<br>
						- Upgrade steroids (12)<br>
						- Upgrade armor (20)<br><br>
					
				<span>SELLING</span><br><br>Harvested crops, foraged items, and monster drops obtained from combat can be sold in the town plaza.<br><br>
				
				<span>FORAGING</span><br><br>This can only be done in Cindersap Forest. There are three areas here with distinct items that can be 
				obtained and sold at varying prices. These are the following:<br><br>

				a. Forest - salmonberry, coconut, purple mushroom, common mushroom<br>
				b. River - carp, sturgeon<br>
				c. Fields - sunflower, tulip<br><br>

				Click on each item to "gather" it. Use the "Search for More" button for a chance to get more items.<br><br>
				
				<span>FARMING</span><br><br>This can only be done at home. To plant seeds, use the hoe in the Tools section to till each plot of land. 
				Choose a seed, and then click on where you want to plant it. Make sure to water the plants using the watering can.<br><br>
				Different seeds mature at different times. To expound:<br>
					a. Parsnip (4 days after day of planting)<br>
					b. Cauliflower (12)<br>
					c. Bean starter (4)<br>
					d. Jazz (7)<br>
					e. Garlic (4)<br>
					f. Strawberry (4)<br><br>

				Use the hand tool to harvest crops. It should be noted here that the strawberry and bean starter regrow and 
				can thus be harvested multiple times.<br><br>
				
				<span>COMBAT</span><br><br>This is a clicker mini-game that can be accessed by going to the Mountain location, 
				and then clicking on Enter the Cave.<br><br>

					Combat automatically begins once in the dungeon. The red bar represents the monster's health while the blue bar below it is  the timer. 
					The goal is to defeat the enemy before time runs out. The player can click on the Attack button to fight or the Block button 
					to defend. The values of each action can be increased by purchasing upgrades. <br><br>

					The monsters that may be encountered include the following:<br>
					a. bug<br>
					b. grub<br>
					c. slime<br>
					d. skeleton<br><br>

					When defeated, each of these creatures drops gold that increases with the dungeon level. It may also drop one of the following:<br>
					a. slime <br>
					b. bug meat <br>
					c. ruby (rare)<br>
					d. emerald (rare) <br><br>

				The player can exit the cave at any point by clicking on the Leave the Dungeon button. 
				For a better experience, the player can purchase upgrades at the Adventurer's Guild.<br><br>
				
				<span>TIME</span><br><br>There are no set hours for every day in the game. The player can choose to go to the next day at any point
				by moving to the Home location and clicking on the Go to Sleep button. This will refresh both the energy and 
				the health bar.<br><br><br>
				</p>
			<h3>LOCATIONS</h3>There are four major locations in the game, each with areas or sections that the player can explore.<br><br>
			<span>HOME</span><br><br>This is the player's starting point and where farming is done. It is also the only location where there 
			is an option to "sleep" or "end the day".<br><br>
			
			<span>PELICAN TOWN</span><br><br>This location has two areas, which are the following:<br><br>

				a. Pierre's Shop - Seeds can be bought here.<br>
				b. Sell Goods - All items obtained through harvesting, foraging, and combat can be sold here.<br><br>
				
			<span>CINDERSAP FOREST</span><br><br>The player can forage for sellable items in the woods, the river, and the fields.<br><br>
			
			<span>MOUNTAIN</span><br><br>There are two areas here:<br><br>

				a. Adventurer's Guild - Upgrades such as an increase in attack, blocking percentage, or health points can be bought here.<br>
				b. Cave - This is where combat occurs. There are a total of 9 levels, and combat difficulty increases  the deeper the player 
				is in the dungeon. Lower levels can be accessed by clicking on the Dig to the Next Level button.<br><br>
